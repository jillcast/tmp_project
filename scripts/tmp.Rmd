<h2> Questions about and limitations with the data </h2>

--how many people have answered in both surveys? <br>
--jails with less than 5 responses are suppressed, so must use nationwide tibbles to get nationwide totals <br>
--survey responses are not representative <br>
--data is not broken down on individual level but aggregated to the level of each jail <br>
--number of respondents in any given jail to these questions are pretty small <br>

<h2> Setup </h2>

```{r Import Files}

library(tidyverse)

# import all csv files in data folder into this project
data_folder <- "../data/"

# list all csv files in the folder
csv_files <- list.files(path = data_folder, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# import each csv as a tibble in data_frames list
data_frames <- csv_files %>%
    set_names(~ str_remove(basename(.), "\\.csv$")) %>%  # remove .csv from filenames
    map(~ as.data.frame(read_csv(.)))
  
# add each tibble as a data frame in the global environment
list2env(data_frames, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  
# print names of the imported data frames
print(names(data_frames))

```

<h2> Voting Eligibility </h2>

```{r Voting Eligibility}

# how many respondents are not sure of their eligibility to vote?
head(eligible_to_vote)
head(eligible_to_vote_nationwide)
# 1,676 incarcerated people (20.8% of survey respondents) not sure about eligibility to vote

# how does this break down for each jail?
not_sure_eligibility <- eligible_to_vote %>%
  filter(eligible_to_vote == "Not sure") %>%  # filter rows where eligible_to_vote is "Not sure"
  arrange(desc(pct_of_respondents)) %>%  # sort by pct_of_respondents
  select(state,facility_name,count,n_respondents,pct_of_respondents) #select columns of interest

head(not_sure_eligibility)

not_sure_eligibility %>%
  filter(n_respondents > 50)
# These facilities in texas, washington and Indiana could be interesting to contact

# how do incarcerated people feel about whether they should vote?
head(people_with_convictions_nationwide)
# 57% of respondents said they should be able to vote while incarcerated 
# note - question is worded "after they left prison" but these respondents are in jail, not prison
# looks like there was no answer option like "they should never be allowed to vote"

head(people_with_convictions) %>%
  filter(people_with_convictions_should_vote == "While incarcerated for any crime") %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_of_respondents))
#interesting that three of the four jails listed here are in West Virginia

head(vote_impact_government_level_nationwide)
# about 30% think biggest impact will be at the state level

```

<h2> Voting in 2024 Election </h2>

```{r Voting in 2024 Election}

# compare likelihood of voting for major candidates in first and second survey
head(who_vote_for_nationwide) #56% for Trump in first survey, 9.6% for Biden
head(who_vote_for_supplement_nationwide) #52% for Trump second survey, 24.6% for Harris
# interestingly, a LOT more support for Harris than for Biden

# compare across jails for jails with more respondents (more than 50)

# what percent of respondents said they would vote for biden in the first survey?
biden_vote <- who_vote_for %>%
  filter(who_vote_for == "Joe Biden",  # filter rows for Biden voters
         n_respondents > 50) %>%  # filter for jails with more than 50 respondents
  arrange(desc(pct_of_respondents)) %>%  # sort by pct_of_respondents
  select(facility_name, pct_of_respondents) %>%  # select columns of interest
  rename(pct_for_biden = pct_of_respondents)  # rename the column

# what percent of respondents said they would vote for harris in the second survey?
harris_vote <- who_vote_for_supplement %>%
  filter(who_vote_for_supplement == "Kamala Harris",  # filter rows for Harris voters
         n_respondents > 50) %>%  # filter for jails with more than 50 respondents
  arrange(desc(pct_of_respondents)) %>%  # sort by pct_of_respondents
  select(facility_name,pct_of_respondents) %>%  # select columns of interest
  rename(pct_for_harris = pct_of_respondents)  # rename the column

# join the datasets by facility_name
biden_vs_harris <- left_join(biden_vote, harris_vote, by = "facility_name")

# calculate the percentage point difference between support for harris and biden in the large facilities
biden_vs_harris <- biden_vs_harris %>%
  mutate(pct_point_difference = pct_for_harris - pct_for_biden) %>%  
  arrange(desc(pct_point_difference))  # sort by pct_point_difference in descending order

# view data
print(biden_vs_harris)
# biggest swing was in MTC Giles Dalby in Texas -- 25 percentage point difference

# future analysis - how does gender and race of respondents affect their likelihood to vote for Trump/Biden?

```
<h2> Testing a Gender Effect </h2>

```{r Gender effect}

# are jails with more female respondents more likely to support kamala harris?

# new dataset just showing jails with female respondents
jails_with_women <- gender %>%
  filter(gender == "Woman") %>%
  select(facility_name, pct_of_respondents) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_of_respondents)) %>%
  rename(pct_women = pct_of_respondents)

#new dataset just showing "yes" answers to ready for woman president question
ready_for_woman_pres <- us_ready_elect_woman_president %>% 
  filter(us_ready_elect_woman_president == "Yes") %>%
  select(facility_name, pct_of_respondents) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_of_respondents)) %>%
  rename(pct_ready_for_woman_pres = pct_of_respondents)

head(jails_with_women)
head(ready_for_woman_pres)

# join the datasets on facility_name
women_jails <- left_join(jails_with_women, ready_for_woman_pres, by = "facility_name")

# View the merged dataset
print(women_jails)

# create  scatter plot of results with a line of best fit
ggplot(women_jails, aes(x = pct_women, y = pct_ready_for_woman_pres)) +
  geom_point() +  # scatter plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +  # line of best fit
  labs(title = "Percentage of Women Jails vs. Readiness for Woman President",
       x = "Percentage of Women in Jails",
       y = "Percentage Ready for Woman President") +
  theme_minimal()

# nothing significant here
